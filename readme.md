A React template with TypeScript and developer tooling.

- React with TypeScript to improve developer experience, shorten feedback loops and to help prevent runtime errors.
- Tailwind to style elements quickly and efficiently.
- Linting for JavaScript and TypeScript files via ESLint to find and fix problems quickly via static code analysis.
- Linting for the filesystem via LSLint to enforce consistency in file and folder names.
- Opinionated formatting for an array of file types via Prettier to enforce consistency.
- Pre-commit hooks via Husky to automatically enforce standards and shorten feedback loops.
- Automated dependency updates via Dependabot to keep dependencies up to date.
- Continuous Integration via GitHub actions with type checking, formatting, linting and testing.
- Continuous Deployment via GitHub actions to Amazon S3, in this example to an S3 bucket distributed by a CloudFront distribution.
